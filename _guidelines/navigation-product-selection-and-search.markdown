### The homepage is not your most important page

#### Comment

There are many entry points to your website and it's most likely that customers
[will not start their journey from your
homepage](http://uxmyths.com/post/717779908/myth-the-homepage-is-your-most-important-page).
Search engine results, Google Shopping, and promoted products on social media
all drive customers to product pages, often bypassing the homepage entirely.

The homepage is a gateway page that can set a user's first impressions of a
website or brand, but it's not the page that is going to meet their needs -- on
an ecommerce site, it's typically the category and product pages where users
will select and evaluate products. Design these pages first, and design for
customer journeys that start with search results, and then drive traffic to
tailored landing pages, specific products or category pages.

#### Examples

[![Screenshot of Google Shopping
interface](/uploads/image45.png)](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=adjustable+beds&tbm=shop)

Google Shopping drives traffic directly to product pages, unbundling the
product selection process from ecommerce sites and bringing it into the
search engine.

page](/uploads/image49.png)

Airbnb's default homepage, left, focusses on exploratory behaviour. The
landing page, right, is promoted in search results for "Paris" and is
aimed towards customers that have already decided on some criteria for
an upcoming trip.

#### Benefits

-   Improves conversion
-   Users will find information most valuable to them more efficiently
-   Website becomes clearer, easier and faster to use

### Provide consistent visible global navigation

#### Comment

Global navigation helps customers in two key ways:

-   It helps them to easily **switch between top-level categories**
-   It allows them to **get a sense of what is available** on the website

A recent trend on desktop sites is to hide global navigation, in much the same
way it is typically hidden on mobile. This is not a good pattern because despite
there being ample screen estate to do so, it fails to tell the customer what is
available on the site.

#### Examples

![View of Time Magazine\'s homepage, showing hidden
navigation](/uploads/image40.jpg)

Times hides their global navigation behind a 'hamburger menu', which hides the
breadth of their content and proposition from their users

#### Benefits

-   Users will find information most valuable to them more efficiently
-   Users will understand the breadth of offering on the site
-   Website becomes clearer, easier and faster to use

### Use navigation patterns consistent with other sites

#### Comment

Because ecommerce is a mature market, users expect familiar navigation and
conventions when searching for products. It's best to follow these conventions
as then users can use their existing knowledge to browse your site, navigating
with ease and confidence.

#### Examples

![Headers from three different ecommerce
sites](/uploads/image66.png)

Abel & Cole, Amazon, and Boots all have familiar headers incorporating
links to categories, search inputs and prominent basket icons in the top
right corner.

#### Benefits

-   Users will find information most valuable to them more efficiently
-   Improves confidence and brand trust

### Include visible search across your site

#### Comment

For sites with more than a few products, [users will turn to search
when they know what they are looking
for](http://boxesandarrows.com/four-modes-of-seeking-information-and-how-to-design-for-them/).
Search should be visible across your site, integrated into your header
or navigation design.

#### Examples

[![Boot\'s search bar](/uploads/image72.png)](https://www.boots.com/)

Boots include a search bar in their header, making it widely visible
across the site

![Age Co\'s header](/uploads/image2.png)

For suppliers who have search capability, the Age Co header has been
designed to support a global search.

#### Benefits

-   Users will find information most valuable to them more efficiently
-   Ensures product findability amongst partner sites is equal for users
