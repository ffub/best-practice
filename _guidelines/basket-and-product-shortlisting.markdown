### Give adequate feedback to show an item has been added to the basket

#### Comment

Users shouldn\'t have to guess if an item has been added to their
shopping basket. Give prominent feedback that an item has been added to
the basket, help customers to find the basket and notify them how many
items are in their basket.

#### Examples

website](/uploads/image67.png)

Boots use a prominent design element to not only feedback that an item
has been added to the basket, but also to signpost how to access the
basket.

On mobile, Boot's basket notification is less effective as it's similar
to the overall page layout and disappears too quickly. Amazon take a
different approach, adding an interstitial page informing the user of
the basket addition.

#### Benefits

-   Keeps users in control
-   Builds trust
-   Websites become easier and faster to use
-   Improves conversion

### Link to the basket prominently and globally

#### Comment

Once users have added items to their basket, it's imperative that they
be able to easily access that basket from across the site, and quickly
see how many items are in their basket. Follow convention by linking to
the basket from the top right of the header.

#### Benefits

-   Keeps users in contro
-   Builds trust in brand and website
-   Websites become easier and faster to use
