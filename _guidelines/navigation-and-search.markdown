### The homepage is not your most important page

#### Comment

There are many entry points to your website and it’s most likely that customers [will not start their journey from your homepage](http://uxmyths.com/post/717779908/myth-the-homepage-is-your-most-important-page). Search engine results, Google Shopping and promoted products on social media all drive customers to product pages, often bypassing the homepage entirely.

The homepage is a gateway page that can set a user’s first impressions of a website or brand, but it’s not the page that is going to meet their needs – on an ecommerce site, that’s typically the category and product pages where users will select and evaluate products. Design these pages first, and design for customer journeys that start with search results, and then drive traffic to tailored landing pages, specific products or category pages.

#### Examples

Google Shopping drives traffic directly to product pages, unbundling the product selection process from ecommerce sites and bringing it into the search engine.

Airbnb’s default homepage, left, focusses on exploratory behaviour. The landing page, right, is promoted in search results for "Paris" and is aimed towards customers that have already decided on some criteria for an upcoming trip.

#### Benefits

- Focus resources on most important pages

### Provide consistent visible global navigation

#### Comment

Global navigation helps customers in two key ways:

* It helps them to easily **switch between top-level categories**

* It allows them to **get a sense of what what is available** on the website

A recent trend on desktop sites it to hide global navigation, in much the same way it is typically hidden on mobile. This is not a good pattern because despite there being ample screen estate to do so, it fails to tell the customer what is available on the site.

#### Benefits

- Customers can navigate with ease

### Use navigation patterns consistent with other sites

#### Comment

Because ecommerce is a mature market, users expect familiar navigation and conventions when searching for products. It’s best to follow these conventions as then users can use their existing knowledge to browse your site, navigating with ease and confidence.

#### Examples

Abel & Cole, Amazon and Boots all have familiar headers incorporating links to categories, search inputs and prominent basket icons in the top right corner.

#### Benefits

- Customers can use their experience with other sites to navigate yours
- Reduce development costs by not re-inventing the wheel

### Include visible search across your site

#### Comment

For sites with more than a few products, [users will turn to search when they know what they are looking for](http://boxesandarrows.com/four-modes-of-seeking-information-and-how-to-design-for-them/). Search should be visible across your site, integrated into your header or navigation design.

#### Examples

Boots include a search bar in their header, making it widely visible across the site

#### Benefits

- It's easier for customers to find the product they want, driving overall conversions

### Categorise your products the way your customers do

#### Comment

The way you organise your products may not be the way that your users think about and group them, therefore the foundation of a good website is a solid [information architecture](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ia-vs-navigation/). It’s important to [do research with your users](https://www.webcredible.com/training/information-architecture-training/) to find out how they group products and design your categorisation, navigation and filtering accordingly.

[Card sorting](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/101/card-sorting) is a great technique for understanding how your customers group products.

#### Benefits

- It's easier for customers to find the product they want, driving overall conversions

### Help users to narrow down their choices with filters

#### Comment

When shopping, customers will often have a set of criteria. You can use research to help identify this criteria, by watching users browse your own and competitors websites and finding out how they decide between products.

These criteria can then be used to not only inform the content of your website, but also to design effective filters.

#### Benefits

- It's easier for customers to find the product they want, driving overall conversions

### Unify search and browsing

#### Comment

Some customers will know what they are after and for these customers they are likely to search. Other customers will browse using categorisation as a route into the product inventory. The best ecommerce sites make these feel like a consistent experience, making filtering and sorting options and the display of products consistent on both.

Browsing by category and searching are presented using the same interface on ASOS, allowing customers to filter and sort consistently across both

#### Benefits

- It's easier for customers to find the product they want, driving overall conversions

### Don’t give customers too much choice

#### Comment

In [a now famous study](https://hbr.org/2006/06/more-isnt-always-better), researchers found that a display offering only six types of jam, generated more sales than a display offering 24 varieties, even though the latter generated more interest. Customers want choice, but are often [paralysed by too much choice](https://www.fastcompany.com/3031364/why-having-too-many-choices-is-making-you-unhappy). It’s important to not overload your site with lots of calls to action, similar products or too many navigation links.

#### Examples

When SSE originally started selling broadband, they wanted to offer a variety of products, based on research with their customers. After testing we found that three was the ideal amount of price points for customers to be able to choose the service level that suited them, whilst not being overwhelmed.

#### Benefits

- Reduced bounce rates as customers are not overwhelmed by choices
- Higher conversion rates for primary calls to action


### Use comparison tables to compare similar items

#### Comment

Customers need  to be able to compare items that are differentiated by levels of functionality or features, aimed at different prices points, so that they can choose based on their requirements. Comparison tables are a great way to make these feature by feature comparisons.

#### Examples

Comparison tables help users compare similar products or service tiers. In the above example, descriptive text guides customer through new terminology, explaining what features are important and why.

#### Benefits

- Easier product selection for customers
- Higher overall conversion rates as customers find the product that suits their needs
