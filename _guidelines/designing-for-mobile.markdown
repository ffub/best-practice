### Use responsive design to cater for all screen sizes

#### Comment

Smartphones have become the personal computer of choice for the majority of consumers and customers increasingly expect to be able to do everything from banking to online shopping from their devices. During the 2017 holiday season, [33.1% of online revenue came from smartphones or tablets](http://www.cmo.com/adobe-digital-insights/articles/2018/1/10/mobile-revenues-hit-record-high-this-holiday-season.html), with mobile accounting for 52% of visits. This trend will only continue.

The screen sizes of mobile devices and tablets vary greatly, and we still see the best way to adapt to the full range of devices that customers use as being [responsive design](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/).

#### Examples

Nike’s website adapts to different screen sizes, using the same front-end code.

#### Benefits

- Reach a wider audience
- Improve conversion rates on mobile
- Less development overhead by working with one codebase

### Design for mobile first

#### Comment

Due to constraints of mobile devices, in particular screen real estate, the most effective strategy is to design for mobile first, and then adapt your designs as necessary to larger viewports.

#### Examples

At [Webcredible](https://webcredible.com), we start by sketching on mobile first, and then adapt to desktop layouts later in the design process.

#### Benefits

- **It helps to focus** on the most important content and functionality and the order in which they are presented to the customer
- **It’s easier to scale up**, rather than down, adding more to the page on larger screen sizes
- **It future-proofs your design** by designing for the biggest growth area in consumption and the area when most ecommerce sites are weakest


### Don’t expect mobile users to be "on the move"

#### Comment

The term ‘mobile’ is something of a misnomer that leads to the assumption that mobile users are are "on the move" when in fact, mobile computing is ubiquitous and takes place in a variety of contexts. [Research on screen use by Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/mobile/the-new-multi-screen-world-study/) found that 60% of smartphone usage takes place in the home.

### Don’t provide a limited experience on mobile

#### Comment

50% of users abandon mobile transactions [because they’ve had a poor experience](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/consumer-insights/consumer-behaviours-shaping-next-generation-mobile-experiences/). Due to the differing constraints, mobile experiences often need to be different from traditional desktop-based ones but they should still provide the same level of content and functionality.
