### Designing for mobile

Customers expect to be able to shop using a range of devices – make sure your website adapts to all screen sizes.

### Use responsive design to cater for all screen sizes

Smartphones have become the personal computer of choice for the majority of consumers and customers increasingly expect to be able to do everything from banking to online shopping from their devices. During the 2017 holiday season, 33.1% of online revenue came from smartphones or tablets, with mobile accounting for 52% of visits. This trend will only continue.

The screen sizes of mobile devices and tablets vary greatly, and we still see the best way to adapt to the full range of devices that customers use as being responsive design.

Nike’s website adapts to different screen sizes, using the same front-end code.\
Design for mobile first\
Due to constraints of mobile devices, in particular screen real estate, the most effective strategy is to design for mobile first, and then adapt your designs as necessary to larger viewports. This has three key benefits:

It helps to focus on the most important content and functionality and the order in which they are presented to the customer\
It’s easier to scale up, rather than down, adding more to the page on larger screen sizes\
It future-proofs your design by designing for the biggest growth area in consumption and the area when most ecommerce sites are weakest

At Webcredible, we start by sketching on mobile first, and then adapt to desktop layouts later in the design process.\
Don’t expect mobile users to be “on the move”\
The term ‘mobile’ is something of a misnomer that leads to the assumption that mobile users are are “on the move” when in fact, mobile computing is ubiquitous and takes place in a variety of contexts. Research on screen use by Google found that 60% of smartphone usage takes place in the home.\
Don’t provide a limited experience on mobile\
50% of users abandon mobile transactions because they’ve had a poor experience. Due to the differing constraints, mobile experiences often need to be different from traditional desktop-based ones but they should still provide the same level of content and functionality.
