The AgeCo range will help older people enjoy financial security and continue to live independently

Products and services offered under the Age Co name will include stairlifts and hearing aids, as well as insurance, legal services and funeral plans, all designed to give older people the freedom and confidence to live as they wish.

You can find the current Age Co range at the new website, [ageco.co.uk](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/REgeBcelDk4fr). Over time, more Age UK branded products will start using the Age Co name, and new products that can help improve the lives of older people will be introduced.

Behind the Age Co name, you’ll find trusted partners who work to meet the needs of those in later life. The service you receive will be from friendly people who'll have time for you, and will offer you all the support you need to feel comfortable and confident in your purchase.

And everything sold under the Age Co name will help raise income for the great charitable work of Age UK.
