This document provides a set of best practice ecommerce guidelines for Age Co partners developing ecommerce websites. These guidelines support partners by:

- Providing a clear set of guidelines to ensure their site integrates with the Age Co website, providing a consistent and seamless experience for customers
- Ensuring that best practices within ecommerce are following to provide a familiar online shopping experience and increase revenue for partners
- Identifying specific needs of Age Co’s audience and see that these needs are met across partner sites

This document forms part of the Age Co rebrand package which includes **Brand Guidelines**, **Accessibility and Cross Browser Guidelines** and a **Digital Component Library**.

The guidelines in this document have been put together by user experience agency [Webcredible](https://www.webcredible.com), based on their experience in ecommerce, a long term partnership with Age UK and a range of research projects with Age UK’s audience.

Each guideline within this document is supported by a rationale, with links to relevant research and further reading, examples, and the benefits of following the guideline. The guidelines have been selected for their wide applicability and their measurable impact. It is assumed that partner sites will be using standard ecommerce systems, or have experience of building ecommerce sites, and so this document does not go into detail about the specific requirements of templates.

Ecommerce is a fast-developing area, and these guidelines will be iterated and improved as the best practices of the industry change.
