### Do not require users to register during checkout

#### Comment

Registration can be [a significant blocker for
users](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/optional-registration/),
resulting in a big drop-off in conversion rates. If you offer
registration for new customers, explain the benefits and alway present
it as an optional feature.

Usability expert Jared Spool tells the story of how removing
registration as a blocker, resulted in [\$3million extra revenue for
one of his
clients](https://articles.uie.com/three_hund_million_button/).

#### Benefits

-   Improves conversion
-   Potential to increase revenue
-   Simplifies the purchase journey, for both the developers and users
-   Reduces effort the user has to go through in order to make a purchase
-   Improves website and user performance
-   Reduces bounce and exit rates at the checkout stage

### Use analytics tools to measure the performance of your funnel

#### Comment

Use tools like Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics to [measure your
funnel in
detail](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6014872?hl=en).
You should measure each step of the process, to see where customers get
stuck.

#### Examples

[![Graphic showing Google Analytics funnel
metrics](/uploads/image42.png)](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6014872?hl=en)

Google Analytics' Shopping Behavior Analysis report shows how many
sessions abandoned the funnel at each stage.

#### Benefits

-   Improves conversion

### Keep form fields to a minimum

#### Comment

Keep data entry to a minimum by only asking for the information you need
to complete the transaction, or that adds value to the customer. Each
decision or question the customer is asked to evaluate is another
[hurdle they have to jump
over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) and
can negatively impact your overall conversion rate. This is particularly
true on mobile devices, where data entry is all the more difficult.

#### Benefits

-   Improves conversion
-   Reduces page size and clutter
-   Improves website and user performance
-   Reduces bounce and exit rates at the checkout stage

### Remove optional fields

#### Comment

Avoid adding lots of *optional* fields to a form. These seem like
easy-wins: if the customer doesn't want to fill them in, they don't have
to. But each field still needs to be evaluated by the customer, adds to
the overall length of the funnel and if it's truly optional, can be
removed altogether.

#### Benefits

-   Reducing the unnecessary fields makes purchase journey quicker and simpler for users
-   Reduces page size and clutter
-   Improves website and user performance
-   Reduces bounce and exit rates at the checkout stage

### Structure your form with one thing per page

#### Comment

Multi-step forms such as most checkout processes are most effective when
you ask [one thing per
page](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure#start-with-one-thing-per-page).
One thing does not mean one field per page (although it can do), but can
be:

-   one piece of information you're telling a customer
-   one decision they have to make
-   one question they have to answer

#### Examples

![Age Co\'s bed-builder
interface](/uploads/image69.png)

Age Co's adjustable beds 'Bed Builder' includes a funnel form, which
includes visual data as well as form fields. Each section is focused on
one aspect of the builder, keeping the user focused on one thing at a
time and minimising cognitive load.

#### Benefits

-   Makes the purchase journey quicker and simpler for users
-   Reduces page size and clutter
-   Grouped fields help users to mentally prepare for the answers to the questions associated with the section title
-   Speeds up scanning of the form and form completion
-   Improves accuracy of information input by users

### Signpost where the customer is in the process

#### Comment

Make it clear what steps there are to the checkout funnel, and signpost
where customers are in the process using a progress indicator or
breadcrumbs.

#### Examples

![A Book Apart\'s checkout, with steps
shown](/uploads/image9.png)

A Book Apart's checkout makes it clear that there are three steps:
Customer information, Shipping method & Payment method.

![How multi-step funnels appear in Age Co
templates](/uploads/image59.png)

The Age Co rebrand includes a step-journey module which clearly
indicates where users are, what steps they must still go through, and
what to expect in each section.

#### Benefits

-   Provides users with clear understanding of where they are in the purchase journey
-   Provides user with greater control over the checkout experience

### Help the customer recover from validation errors

#### Comment

Luke Wroblewski [offers the following
advice](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?949) for helping
customers deal with errors on forms:

-   Clearly communicate when an error is blocking someone from completing a form
-   Display error messages in context so they can be resolved quickly
-   Provide actionable remedies that enable people to resolve errors easily
-   If any input fields are responsible for an error, clearly mark them with a visual emphasis to ensure they are noticeable

#### Benefits

-   Reduces bounce and exit rates at checkout stages
-   Descriptive error messages help users to rectify the problem more accurately and more quickly
-   Reduces the time needed to solve errors
-   Reduces user frustration
-   Improves quality of captured data

### Make payment as simple as possible

#### Comment

Payment is the point of highest friction in the conversion funnel, and
so it's important to make it feel as easy as possible. Fortunately,
taking payments over the web has gotten a lost easier in recent years.
Keep your payment forms simple and [use standard conventions to support
browser
auto-filling](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/06/checkout-faster-with-autofill).

PayPal, Apple Pay and Google Pay (known as OEM payment) not only lets
users use a previously-entered payment method, but also lets them select
a delivery address they have previously entered.

#### Examples

![Stripe\'s really simple credit card form
](/uploads/image56.png)

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb)'s
card entry form is whittled down to the bare essentials, and doesn't
feel as onerous as many.

![ApplePay interface on
Shopify](/uploads/image11.png)

Apple Pay lets users pay using address and card details stored on their
device.

#### Benefits

-   Simplifies the purchase journey for users
-   Reduces effort the user has to go through in order to make a purchase
-   Reduces bounce and exit rates at the checkout stage
-   Improves conversion

### Always tell the customer what will happen next

#### Comment

When the order is completed, make sure it's clear to the customer what
will happen next.

-   Send a confirmation email, and tell them you have done so
-   Reconfirm their address and order details, and give them a way to recover if they have made a mistake (manage their orders, get in touch with support, etc)
-   Outline on both the confirmation page and email what to expect in terms of delivery, or next steps

#### Examples

![REI confirmation
email](/uploads/image53.png)

REI's order confirmation email confirms their order details, makes it
clear what will happen next and allows the customer to view their order.

#### Benefits

-   Builds trust in brand and website, and reaffirms customers have made the right purchase decision
