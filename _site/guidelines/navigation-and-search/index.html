    <p>Helping your customers to the right product for them will reduce bounce rates.</p>

<h3 id="the-homepage-is-not-your-most-important-page">The homepage is not your most important page</h3>

<p>There are many entry points to your website and it’s most likely that customers <a href="http://uxmyths.com/post/717779908/myth-the-homepage-is-your-most-important-page">will not start their journey from your homepage</a>. Search engine results, Google Shopping and promoted products on social media all drive customers to product pages, often bypassing the homepage entirely.</p>

<p>The homepage is a gateway page that can set a user’s first impressions of a website or brand, but it’s not the page that is going to meet their needs – on an ecommerce site, that’s typically the category and product pages where users will select and evaluate products. Design these pages first, and design for customer journeys that start with search results, and then drive traffic to tailored landing pages, specific products or category pages.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/image_2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Google Shopping drives traffic directly to product pages, unbundling the product selection process from ecommerce sites and bringing it into the search engine.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/image_3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Airbnb’s default homepage, left, focusses on exploratory behaviour. The landing page, right, is promoted in search results for “Paris” and is aimed towards customers that have already decided on some criteria for an upcoming trip.</p>

<h3 id="provide-consistent-visible-global-navigation">Provide consistent visible global navigation</h3>

<p>Global navigation helps customers in two key ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It helps them to easily <strong>switch between top-level categories</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It allows them to <strong>get a sense of what what is available</strong> on the website</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A recent trend on desktop sites it to hide global navigation, in much the same way it is typically hidden on mobile. This is not a good pattern because despite there being ample screen estate to do so, it fails to tell the customer what is available on the site.</p>

<h3 id="use-navigation-patterns-consistent-with-other-sites">Use navigation patterns consistent with other sites</h3>

<p>Because ecommerce is a mature market, users expect familiar navigation and conventions when searching for products. It’s best to follow these conventions as then users can use their existing knowledge to browse your site, navigating with ease and confidence.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/image_4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Abel &amp; Cole, Amazon and Boots all have familiar headers incorporating links to categories, search inputs and prominent basket icons in the top right corner.</p>

<h3 id="include-visible-search-across-your-site">Include visible search across your site</h3>

<p>For sites with more than a few products, <a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/four-modes-of-seeking-information-and-how-to-design-for-them/">users will turn to search when they know what they are looking for</a>. Search should be visible across your site, integrated into your header or navigation design.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/image_5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Boots include a search bar in their header, making it widely visible across the site</p>

<h3 id="categorise-your-products-the-way-your-customers-do">Categorise your products the way your customers do</h3>

<p>The way you organise your products may not be the way that your users think about and group them, therefore the foundation of a good website is a solid <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ia-vs-navigation/">information architecture</a>. It’s important to <a href="https://www.webcredible.com/training/information-architecture-training/">do research with your users</a> to find out how they group products and design your categorisation, navigation and filtering accordingly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/101/card-sorting">Card sorting</a> is a great technique for understanding how your customers group products.</p>

<h3 id="help-users-to-narrow-down-their-choices-with-filters">Help users to narrow down their choices with filters</h3>

<p>When shopping, customers will often have a set of criteria. You can use research to help identify this criteria, by watching users browse your own and competitors websites and finding out how they decide between products.</p>

<p>These criteria can then be used to not only inform the content of your website, but also to design effective filters.</p>

<h3 id="unify-search-and-browsing">Unify search and browsing</h3>

<p>Some customers will know what they are after and for these customers they are likely to search. Other customers will browse using categorisation as a route into the product inventory. The best ecommerce sites make these feel like a consistent experience, making filtering and sorting options and the display of products consistent on both.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/image_6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Browsing by category and searching are presented using the same interface on ASOS, allowing customers to filter and sort consistently across both</p>

<h3 id="dont-give-customers-too-much-choice">Don’t give customers too much choice</h3>

<p>In <a href="https://hbr.org/2006/06/more-isnt-always-better">a now famous study</a>, researchers found that a display offering only six types of jam, generated more sales than a display offering 24 varieties, even though the latter generated more interest. Customers want choice, but are often <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3031364/why-having-too-many-choices-is-making-you-unhappy">paralysed by too much choice</a>. It’s important to not overload your site with lots of calls to action, similar products or too many navigation links.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/image_7.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When SSE originally started selling broadband, they wanted to offer a variety of products, based on research with their customers. After testing we found that three was the ideal amount of price points for customers to be able to choose the service level that suited them, whilst not being overwhelmed.</p>

<h3 id="use-comparison-tables-to-compare-similar-items">Use comparison tables to compare similar items</h3>

<p>Customers need  to be able to compare items that are differentiated by levels of functionality or features, aimed at different prices points, so that they can choose based on their requirements. Comparison tables are a great way to make these feature by feature comparisons.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/image_8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Comparison tables help users compare similar products or service tiers. In the above example, descriptive text guides customer through new terminology, explaining what features are important and why.</p>
