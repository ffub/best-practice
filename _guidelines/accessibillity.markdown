### Conform to at least AA level of <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> accessibility guidelines

#### Comment

Age Co and all partner sites should achieve at least level AA conformance with the W3 [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0][wcag-guidelines]. Designing your site in accordance with these guidelines will make your site more inclusive by allowing it to adapt to a wide variety of assistive technologies, such as screen readers, magnifiers and speech recognition tools.

In the UK, 1 in 5 people have a disability, which could be visual, hearing, motor or cognitive (affecting memory and thinking). But accessibility is not just about designing for those disabilities â€” all web users will have access needs at specific times and in certain contexts, that will affect how they use the web.

The basic principle of web accessibility is to use markup that richly describes your content and functionality to browsers, in such a way that they can adapt the way in which it is presented to users. Web accessibility is the responsibility of your whole team and requires the collaboration of developers, designers and content creators.

#### Benefits

- Designing for a wide range of access needs means that everyone can use your website, in a range of circumstances
- Failure to consider the access needs of your audience may be a breach of the [Equality Act 2010][equality-act]
- Accessible websites are easier for browsers, and therefore search engines, to understand, having a positive impact on your <abbr title="search engine optimisation">SEO</abbr>
