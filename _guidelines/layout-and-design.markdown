### Make a good first impression

#### Comment

Research has shown that users make a first impression of a website,
assessing things such as trust and appeal, [within 50
milliseconds](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290500330448).
Google found in their own research, that users will very quickly judge a
website on how similar it appears to what they've seen before (known as
prototypicality) and how visually complex the site is. Websites with low
visual complexity and high familiarity were perceived as highly
appealing.

It's therefore important to not only use an attractive, professional and
clutter free design, but one that follows the conventions of ecommerce
within your sector.

#### Examples

![Use of whitespace in Age Co
templates](/uploads/image61.png)

Age Co article and content pages use white space to draw attention to
the page content. Not only does this guide the user to where you want
them to read on the page, it also allows them to focus on their
immediate task (reading), without distraction drawing their attention
away.

#### Benefits

-   Reduce bounce rates
-   Improve brand reputation

### Don't overload the customer with too many calls to action

#### Comment

Prioritise the the one key thing you want the user to do at each step of
the journey. On product selection pages, prioritise finding a product,
on product pages prioritise the purchase call to action.

#### Examples

![Use of calls to actions on
Theraposture](/uploads/image65.jpg)

Before the redesign, Theraposture had too many call-to-actions at the
top of their home page. Analysing their google analytics, we found
evidence that the choice of CTAs were diluting traffic away from
specific product journeys. The redesign allowed us to provide a clear
path for users, and improve overall conversion (can we get data source?)

![Examples of responsively design hero banners in Age Co
templates](/uploads/image71.jpg)

The Age Co redesign includes multiple hero banners for different
use-cases across all screen-sizes. This includes one with 1 CTA to
direct users down a clear path of your choice.

#### Benefits

-   Drive conversion primary call-to-action

### Users scroll, but more so if it's clear there is further content

#### Comment

Countless research and our own experience at Webcredible is that users
will consistently scroll. Design agency Huge found that [users
consistently
scrolled](https://www.hugeinc.com/articles/everybody-scrolls),
even when presented with very different page designs, whereas chartbeat,
an analytics provider, found that from [2 billion
visits](http://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/)
"66% of attention on a normal media page is spent below the fold."

Content towards the top of the page will [still get the
most]{.underline}
[attention](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/page-fold-manifesto/),
but there is [no consistent
fold](https://storify.com/xiwcx/there-is-no-fold-1) across
browsers and devices. Rather than try to cram everything at the top of
the page, the best strategy is to create a good first impression, and
order the page so as to be scannable and prioritise the broadest
information needs early on. There are [proven
strategies](https://articles.uie.com/page_scrolling/) for
making it clear to customers that further content is available.

#### Examples

![Examples of long product
pages](/uploads/image47.jpg)

These long, information-rich product pages are designed for scrolling.

#### Benefits

- Meet the information needs of a wide range of users
- Explain more complicated products without impacting above-the-fold content
- Improve conversion

### Don't make important calls-to-action look like an advert

#### Comment

Customers are [blind to
banners](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings/),
and will ignore anything that looks like a promotion or advert. It's
therefore important that key page components, such as calls to action or
important product tips, are not styled in such a way [as to appear
promotional](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/fancy-formatting-looks-like-an-ad/).

#### Examples

#### ![Age Co calls to action, using buttons](/uploads/image51.png)

Buttons have been designed with high contrast in the Age Co rebrand, so
as to stand out as actions rather than recede into the background.

![Example of Age Co callout
modules](/uploads/image46.png)

Important information about installation is included in a blue call-out
module on Age Co's stairlift page. We found in user testing that
potential customers read information in these boxes because they assumed
it was real content, whereas content in banner format was missed due to
banner blindness.

#### Benefits

-   Improve conversion rates for calls-to-action
-   Increase trust in website
