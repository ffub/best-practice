### Use responsive design to cater for all screen sizes

#### Comment

Smartphones have become the personal computer of choice for the majority
of consumers, and customers increasingly expect to be able to do
everything from banking to online shopping from their devices. During
the 2017 holiday season, [33.1% of online revenue came from smartphones
or
tablets](http://www.cmo.com/adobe-digital-insights/articles/2018/1/10/mobile-revenues-hit-record-high-this-holiday-season.html),
with mobile accounting for 52% of visits. This trend will only continue.

The screen sizes of mobile devices and tablets vary greatly, and the
best way to adapt to the full range of devices that customers use is
through [responsive
design](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/).

#### Examples

![Views of Nike\'s website on mobile and
desktop](/uploads/image50.png)

Nike's website adapts to different screen sizes, using the same
front-end code.

#### Benefits

-   Caters to varying and ever-expanding screen sizes
-   Future proofs website for ever increasing mobile and tablet use

### Design for mobile first

#### Comment

Due to constraints of mobile devices, in particular screen real-estate,
the most effective strategy is to design for mobile first, and then
adapt your designs as necessary to larger viewports. This has three key
benefits:

1.  **It helps to focus** on the most important content and functionality and the order in which they are presented to the customer

2.  **It's easier to scale up**, rather than down, adding more to the page on larger screen sizes

3.  **It future-proofs your design** by designing for the biggest growth area in consumption and the area where most ecommerce sites are weakest

#### Examples

![Sketches of mobile screens used during a Webcredible
project](/uploads/image58.png)

At [Webcredible](https://webcredible.com), we start by
sketching on mobile first, and then adapt to desktop layouts later in
the design process.

#### Benefits

-   Users will find information most valuable to them more efficiently
-   Website becomes clearer, easier and faster to use
-   Reduces load on content editors

### Don't expect mobile users to be "on the move"

#### Comment

The term 'mobile' is something of a misnomer that leads to the
assumption that mobile users are "on the move". In actual fact, mobile
computing is ubiquitous and takes place in a variety of contexts.
[Research on screen use by
Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/mobile/the-new-multi-screen-world-study/)
found that 60% of smartphone usage takes place in the home.

#### Benefits

-   Sites are limited to 'on the move' tasks and functionality

### Don't provide a limited experience on mobile

#### Comment

50% of users abandon mobile transactions [because they've had a poor
experience](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/consumer-insights/consumer-behaviours-shaping-next-generation-mobile-experiences/).
Due to the differing constraints, mobile experiences often need to be
different from traditional desktop-based ones but they should still
provide the same level of content and functionality.

#### Examples

![Desktop and mobile views of Age Co\'s
website](/uploads/image48.jpg)

Age Co's redesign was designed responsively, providing mobile users
access to the exact same content as desktop users.

#### Benefits

-   Increases conversion
-   Caters to users' expectations and all use-cases
