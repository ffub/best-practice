Navigation, product selection & search
Helping your customers to the right product for them will reduce bounce rates.
The homepage is not your most important page
There are many entry points to your website and it’s most likely that customers will not start their journey from your homepage. Search engine results, Google Shopping and promoted products on social media all drive customers to product pages, often bypassing the homepage entirely. 

The homepage is a gateway page that can set a user’s first impressions of a website or brand, but it’s not the page that is going to meet their needs – on an ecommerce site, that’s typically the category and product pages where users will select and evaluate products. Design these pages first, and design for customer journeys that start with search results, and then drive traffic to tailored landing pages, specific products or category pages.

Google Shopping drives traffic directly to product pages, unbundling the product selection process from ecommerce sites and bringing it into the search engine.

Airbnb’s default homepage, left, focusses on exploratory behaviour. The landing page, right, is promoted in search results for “Paris” and is aimed towards customers that have already decided on some criteria for an upcoming trip.
Provide consistent visible global navigation
Global navigation helps customers in two key ways:

It helps them to easily switch between top-level categories
It allows them to get a sense of what what is available on the website

A recent trend on desktop sites it to hide global navigation, in much the same way it is typically hidden on mobile. This is not a good pattern because despite there being ample screen estate to do so, it fails to tell the customer what is available on the site.
Use navigation patterns consistent with other sites
Because ecommerce is a mature market, users expect familiar navigation and conventions when searching for products. It’s best to follow these conventions as then users can use their existing knowledge to browse your site, navigating with ease and confidence.


Abel & Cole, Amazon and Boots all have familiar headers incorporating links to categories, search inputs and prominent basket icons in the top right corner.
Include visible search across your site
For sites with more than a few products, users will turn to search when they know what they are looking for. Search should be visible across your site, integrated into your header or navigation design.


Boots include a search bar in their header, making it widely visible across the site
Categorise your products the way your customers do
The way you organise your products may not be the way that your users think about and group them, therefore the foundation of a good website is a solid information architecture. It’s important to do research with your users to find out how they group products and design your categorisation, navigation and filtering accordingly.

Card sorting is a great technique for understanding how your customers group products.
Help users to narrow down their choices with filters
When shopping, customers will often have a set of criteria. You can use research to help identify this criteria, by watching users browse your own and competitors websites and finding out how they decide between products.

These criteria can then be used to not only inform the content of your website, but also to design effective filters. 
Unify search and browsing
Some customers will know what they are after and for these customers they are likely to search. Other customers will browse using categorisation as a route into the product inventory. The best ecommerce sites make these feel like a consistent experience, making filtering and sorting options and the display of products consistent on both.
