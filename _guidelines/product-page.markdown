### Let customers inspect the product through strong product imagery

#### Comment

Internet users are image-led, first assessing "does this look right?",
before investigating further. Let them see the product from multiple
angles and zoom in on key details.

#### Examples

![Product images as used by clothing brand, Patagonia](/uploads/image64.jpg)

Patagonia's product pages lead with large imagery, and let customers
inspect the garment from a variety of angles and on a model.

#### Benefits

-   Provides users with accurate understanding and expectation of what they might end up buying
-   Users demand quality images that convey the product clearly - providing this helps to make the user's mind up
-   Many competitors fail provide high quality or scalable imagery of their products, so opportunity to capture market from them

### Use SEO friendly headings such as questions and answers

#### Comment

Adding common frequently asked questions to a product page not only
helps meet customer's information needs about the product, but can help
your product rank highly in search engines.

#### Examples

![Screenshot of questions and answers in Google search results](/uploads/image44.png)

Google extracts commonly asked questions and links to pages, such as
product pages, to find answers to them.

![Amazon\'s use of questions and answers on product pages](/uploads/image55.png)

Amazon features a questions & answers section on product pages, with
answers provided by their own customers.

'Questions and answers' is a module included in the Age Co rebrand which
we encourage suppliers to use on their product and policy pages.

#### Benefits

-   Improves SEO search effectiveness
-   Users who scan a page will find the most important information first without having to read lots of detail
-   Provides users with a better understanding and expectation of what they might end up buying

### Include reviews to allow customers to get a second opinion

#### Comment

Over [90% of ecommerce shoppers read reviews](https://marketingland.com/survey-customers-more-frustrated-by-how-long-it-takes-to-resolve-a-customer-service-issue-than-the-resolution-38756)
when making a purchase, so make sure your product page allows customers
to add their voice to the product page.

Reviews are an important reinforcement of [social proof](https://conversionxl.com/blog/is-social-proof-really-that-important/).
When making decisions, customers will not only gather information to
make sure that the outcome meets their needs, but ask the questions,
"are others doing this?"

Reviews also provide fresh content on your product pages, [adding to their SEO](https://econsultancy.com/blog/9366-ecommerce-consumer-reviews-why-you-need-them-and-how-to-use-them).

-   Builds trust and confidence in the website and brand
-   Helps potential customers make a purchase decision
-   Improves SEO search effectiveness

#### Examples

![Feefo\'s review interface](/uploads/image10.png)

Including 3rd party reviews offers a neutral perspective for potential
customers to help make a purchase decision. Room has been left in the
tabbed content on product and policy pages for 3rd party reviews in the
Age Co rebrand.
