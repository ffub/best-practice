### Design for your users and their needs

#### Comment

The guidelines laid out in this document are best practice, and have
been selected for their wide applicability. Ultimately the best way to
improve any website is to cater it to the specific needs of its
audience, and the best way to understand those needs are through regular
research.

[Webcredible](https://www.webcredible.com/) have worked
closely with Age UK to improve their web offering and together we have
interviewed over one hundred Age UK users. As a charity aimed at serving
the needs of older people, the assumption was that Age UK's websites
should cater to this audience. Our initial research found that many
people using their websites were surprisingly young. Through further
research we identified carers and the 'adult child' as key audience
groups with very different needs from Age UK's core constituency.

Regular research helps you to identify your audience and to understand
their goals, needs and behaviours:

- Understanding user's **goals** helps you to understand what they are trying to achieve, and how they enlist your products, services or website in order to achieve those goals
- Understanding your user's **needs** helps you to understand what information, functionality, and services are needed to achieve their goals and provide those accordingly
- Understanding your user's **behaviour** allows you to identify how they use products and services and the context of their use --- different people use things in very different ways

### Users will do the minimum they can to get a result

#### Comment

When using a website users will very quickly scan the page and then --
rather than choosing the best option -- will [choose the first
reasonable option](http://www.sensible.com/chapter.html).
This is known as satisficing, a decision-making heuristic identified by
behavioural economist, [Herbert
Simon](http://www.economist.com/node/13350892).

It is therefore paramount to give users a limited set of options, guide
them to meaningful calls to action, and to design pages that are easily
scannable.
